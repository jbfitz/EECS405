\section{Introduction}
String similarity search is a rapidly growing area of research within the computer science community due to its numerous overlapping applications in the modern world. From biology and genetics to computer security, improvements to current string searching techniques must be improved to handle the large amounts of data being gathered today.  As presented in [2], pruning techniques were effective in reducing the time of a query to less than 50 milliseconds; however, these pruning techniques were computationally costly, requiring a minimum of 0.1 billion entries in generated triples in the range-based pruning methods. With the move towards big data sets, it may be more beneficial to include common data-mining practices that are already designed for large sets of data.

\section{Problem Definition}
We propose a method of pruning the search space that utilizes a common data mining technique, clustering. At the application's initialization, we will mine the database and identify similar groups of strings; these clusters will be indexed by longest common substring. When a search is performed at run time, we will search for the appropriate cluster of strings using the constructed cluster index and restrict our search space to the appropriate cluster of data. Although this method includes a significant amount of preprocessing, index construction is only needed when the data is modified and is not present in every search. This effectively reduces the number of strings that must be compared via the B\textsuperscript{ed}-Tree and Top-\textit{k} techniques from [1] and [2], which should further improve search time among large sets of data.\\
\\
As presented in [9], using longest common subsequence (LCS) is the second most effective technique in grouping strings (with the Levenshtein distance being the most effective). However, LCS is more conducive to key generation because it provides a testable string that can be used as the key. The best-matching LCS of a query and a key is guaranteed to identify the cluster that contains the query, if the query is present in the database. \\

\section{Goals}
Throughout the course of the project, the following goals will be accomplished:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Conduct a literature survey on String Similarity Search

\begin{itemize}
\item Correctness/Accuracy
\item Speed
\end{itemize}

\item Formally present findings through a final presentation
\end{enumerate}

	Top-K is a well-documented algorithm implemented both naively and using optimizations that reduce the number of comparisons used when comparing each string. In this paper, the authors propose a progressive framework that well help limit the number of comparisons performed. We find the strings that are of a set edit distance, starting at 0, in our set of string to match a query string. If we have our requisite number of strings, return the found set of strings. Else, we increment the edit distance and find the strings that are of a edit distance of x+1 away from our query string until k results are found. Using trie structures, we can accelerate this process by comparing many strings simultaneously.

	Note that the edit distances used here also allow for user error to an extent, which is a desirable feature for any searching agent to have. 

	We will be using the algorithms defined in the paper as the basis for our comparisons of our backing structures to see how clustering our dataset will improve our search times.

Indexes for datasets are usually updated at set time intervals. To prevent unnecessary reindexing, this paper recommends a lazy update propagation that allows for efficient incremental updates that immediately reflect new data.  Since removing strings can cause a number of dead grams, particularly in the case of less frequent grams, we need to be careful about when we update. The algorithm proposed creates a log of all of the changes to be made to the dataset, then will push all of the changes simultaneously when a memory or time restriction has been met. This will prevent unneeded reorderings from multiple small operations done to the dataset. 

	This article shows us the importance of safely maintaining our datasets while having manageable indexing structures. This should be taken into consideration when we construct our indexing algorithms, but will not be the main focus of our project.

	This paper expresses the woes of many database managers, where the size of the database grows exponentially over time. As such searching larger and larger databases need to consider ways to utilize external memory to speed searches. 

	With a focus on genetic string databases, the paper suggests mapping strings to integers to integer space with a wavelet function to reduce the problems caused by the sizes of dataspaces. The paper also utilizes Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) to help with range queries and nearest neighbor searches. 

	While useful in the case of genetic structure and other substring sensitive data, the gains for extremely large strings with frequent substring may not hold in the case for movie title, publication title searches.

	While Top-k is a well-known algorithm, there are many ways to improve it from its na√Øve form. This paper examines how to expedite the search. Before going into the exact algorithms, the authors discuss filtering techniques. Count filtering utilizes the intuition that short strings that are a small edit distance away have a large number of shared q-grams. Length Filtering reduces the number of strings compared by eliminating strings that are of a certain threshold away from our query string. A string of length 13 is unlikely to be the best match for a string of length 4. As such, we dismiss it before performing the comparisons. 

	The Branch and Bound algorithm utilizes length filtering to find the top-k strings. First a frequency threshold is set to 1 and length difference set to 0. We then Branch (extract the inverted lists of our query string to find the candidates that match given the length and frequency with our limitations) then Bound our strings (rank the candidate strings based on edit distance). We then expand our boundaries of length differences between our stored set of strings and our query until k strings have been found

	The Adaptive q-gram selection exploits the two filtering strategies as well as adaptive q-gram selection, which exploits that strings that have small edit distances share most of the same q-grams. By having longer grams, we can (to an extent) exploit these similarities using larger grams until we need to find lower ranking strings until we have found our top k grams. 

	These adaptations of the Top-k algorithm will prove useful in our consideration of how to best implement the top-k algorithm to exploit our backing clustering system.

	Many string comparison algorithms consider grams of set lengths. However, there are many advantages and disadvantages to having any particular length of n-gram. Rather than to have a ‚Äúone-for-all‚Äù solution to the strings, the authors propose a solution to generate grams of variable length between a minimum and maximum length based on a set gram dictionary, which is constructed based on the data collection of strings prior to the query. When computing the gram dictionary, we should only store grams that have a frequency above a certain threshold. The algorithm utilizes a trie to reduce the computations of grams that are substrings of longer grams, since the subgrams will necessarily occur when the larger grams are present. Since smaller grams are present in larger ones, the grams that survive pruning will more often than not be shorter grams. Longer grams will be present in data sets only if they are very frequent. 

	This algorithm exploits many of the same principles that we should see in our clustering techniques as our clusters should be identified by longest common substrings.
